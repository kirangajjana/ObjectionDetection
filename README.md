Object Detection with Streamlit

This project showcases object detection using Haar cascades in a Streamlit application. It allows users to upload an image and detect objects of different types, such as cars, humans, and buses

Features:-
- Select the object type for detection from a sidebar dropdown menu.
- Upload an image and perform object detection based on the selected object type.
- Display the original image with detected objects highlighted.
- Show the number of detected objects.

Technologies used:
- Python
- OpenCV for object detection
- Streamlit for the web application interface

Getting Started:
1. Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
2. Install the required dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Run the Streamlit application: streamlit run object_detection.py
4. Access the application in your web browser at http://localhost:8501
